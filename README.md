## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. User uploads a resume (`.pdf`) via drag-and-drop or file input.
2. The app sends the file to the backend API (`/api/resume/upload`) via `fetch`.
3. Backend analyzes the resume and returns a **score** and **feedback**.
4. The frontend displays:
   - Resume Score (out of 100)
   - A color-coded badge (Green/Yellow/Red)
   - Emoji-based rating
   - Custom feedback message

> ðŸ”§ Backend API must be running at `http://localhost:8080/api/resume/upload` and should accept `multipart/form-data`.
